- 👋 Hi, I’m @SleepyJimmy, a silly beginner in the world of coding. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and programming in general and would love to work as a software engineer or game designer in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript as I've just completed learning HTML and CSS from freeCodeCamp's curriculum but am going to start learning Python soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project just to learn and gain experience as I find challenges with coding fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me on @lijunfang97@gmail.com or simply just send me a message on instagram @jeemyjim.
